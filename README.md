# 7ucky7's Svelte website

This is a website created using SvelteKit. It is a personal website for 7ucky7, which is a website for my sister.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
